# flutter_neumorphic_plus_fork

This repo is a fork courtesy of: 

* https://github.com/gsmlg-dev/Flutter-Neumorphic

Note: **The readme in that package has a link to a working demo of the app.**

The `flutter_neumorphic_plus` package this repo was forked from is also available on `Pub.dev` at:

* https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_neumorphic_plus

All I did with this fork was to fix a couple things, add `flutter_lints` and fixed the fallout, and changed the `pubspec.yaml` reference for the `flutter_colorpicker` dependency.

Btw, the first primary commit message was cut off (the CLI didn't like back ticks) and should have read:

> Updated and fixed package with `flutter_lints`.

Additional note: The `flutter_neumorphic_plus` package is a fork of the original `flutter_neumorphic` package.
